### Performing an email search (Personal email)

>You must provide either a `domain` or a `company_name`. Providing a `domain` will yield better results than a `company_name`.

```ruby
  options = {
    full_name: "John Doe",
    first_name: "John",
    last_name: "Doe",
    domain: "facebook.com",
    company_name: "Facebook",
  }

  person = AnyMailFinder::Person.new(options)
  response = person.find_email

  #response.email => "jsmith@acme.com",
  #response.email_class => "verified",
  #response.alternatives => [ "john@acme.com", "smithj@acme.com" ]
  #response.input.full_name => "John Smith"
  #response.input.company_name => "Acme Inc"  
  #response.domain => "acme.com",
  #response.status => "success"
```
  or also set them one by one
